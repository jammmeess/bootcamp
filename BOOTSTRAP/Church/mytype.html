          <p>Yes In fact I do have a type.</p>
          <p>
            My type of person is gentle, warm and funny. They have to think with
            their heart and let love be felt in their words and actions. My type
            of person is empathetic, not only to me but to those around them.
            This is important. My type has beautiful energy that lights up the
            dark spaces. They are emotionally mature and respectful. Old school
            romance nakes the list too. My type has a beautfiul <i>Soul</i>
